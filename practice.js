// the logical NOT operator (!) is used to invert the truthiness of a value. When applied to a value, it first converts the value to a boolean (either true or false) based on its truthiness, and then inverts that boolean.

// the + operator is used to convert a value to a number. When you apply the unary plus operator (+) to a boolean value, it converts true to 1 and false to 0.Since false is equivalent to 0 when converted to a number, the expression +false evaluates to 0.

The delete operator in JavaScript is primarily used to remove properties from objects. It can also be used with arrays, as arrays are a special type of object in JavaScript.
